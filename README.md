# Othello
___


**Othello** (Reversi) is a strategy board game for two players,played on an 8Ã—8 uncheckered board. There are sixty-four identical game pieces called _disks_ (often spelled "discs"), which are light on one side and dark on the other. Players take turns placing disks on the board with their assigned color facing up. During a play, any disks of the opponent's color that are in a straight line and bounded by the disk just placed and another disk of the current player's color are turned over to the current player's color.

Through this project, you can play against another player (like your sister or your uncle) and against a robot (artificial intelligence)

# Rules
Each reversi piece has a black side and a white side. On your turn, you place one piece on the board with your color facing up. You must place the piece so that an opponent's piece, or a row of opponent's pieces, is flanked by your pieces. All of the opponent's pieces between your pieces are then turned over to become your color. 

# Aim of the games
The object of the game is to own more pieces than your opponent when the game is over. The game is over when neither player has a move. Usually, this means the board is full. 

# Start of the game 
The game is started in the position shown below on a reversi board consisting of 64 squares in an 8x8 grid.
